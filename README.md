## Running Project
To run this project, 
Open terminal (MAC OS) or command prompt / power shell (for windows OS) and navigate to the project directory type mvn clean test command to run features
```

$ mvn clean test
```
Features will run in order :

2. SC_2_UpdateProgramByName.feature
3. SC_5_DeleteByProgramId.feature


Running with tags
```

$ mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@program"
```
## Reporting

Once tests complete run reports are generated. This framework uses different types of test reporters to communicate pass/failure.

Allure Report: 

Report will be generated into temp folder. Web server with results will start appearing in your default browser. 

```
$ cd <Project Directory>

$ allure serve allure-results
```
HTML Report: 

Report will be generated t–æ directory: target/dsAlgoReport.html


### Develop automation scripts using BDD approach - Cucumber-Java :

Tests are written in the Cucumber framework using the Gherkin Syntax. More about Gherkin & Cucumber can be found at https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/
